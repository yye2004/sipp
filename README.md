The Student Assessment Management System (SiPP - Sistem Pengurusan Penilaian) is developed to address the challenges faced in the current manual assessment management process at school.

The Student Assessment Management System (SiPP) is developed to address the challenges faced in the current manual assessment management process at SMJK Jit Sin. At present, teachers record student information such as names, classes, and assessment results in physical record books. This manual system is inefficient and prone to human errors, making it difficult to maintain a systematic and accurate assessment process. The proposed solution is an automated system that leverages a database to improve the accuracy, speed, and reliability of recording and analyzing student performance.

The main objectives of SiPP are to manage a collection of exam or quiz questions and to monitor student performance based on selected subjects or topics. The system is specifically designed for students and teachers at SMJK Jit Sin, focusing only on the subjects Bahasa Melayu and English. With this targeted approach, the system aims to streamline the evaluation process for these two core subjects.

An evaluation of the existing system highlights that while the manual approach is cost-effective due to the lack of digital requirements, it has significant drawbacks. These include the high possibility of recording errors by teachers and the lengthy time required to manually analyze students' academic performance. The new system, SiPP, addresses these weaknesses by automating the assessment process through a reliable database system, minimizing errors, and enabling faster performance analysis. Ultimately, SiPP enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the student assessment process at SMJK Jit Sin.
